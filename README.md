# Outlook_Fix
Outlook was having an issue. When someone signed into a Terminal Server/RDS Server it would ask for their credentials after typing in the credentials it would fail to open Outlook with an error "The set folder cannot be Opened"
This was the applied solution from Microsoft Support. 
I created two different files in case someone wanted to use them via CMD or PS. 
Good Luck I hope this helps!!
